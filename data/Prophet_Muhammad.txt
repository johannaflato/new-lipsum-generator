Give women their dowries graciously. But if they willingly forego some of it, then consume it with enjoyment and pleasure.
There are degrees for everyone, according to what they have done, and He will repay them for their works in full, and they will not be wronged.
On the Day when the faithless will be paraded before the Fire: “You have squandered your good in your worldly life, and you took pleasure in them. So today you are being repaid with the torment of shame, because of your unjust arrogance on earth, and because you used to sin.”
But they cannot harm anyone except with Allah's permission. And they learned what would harm them and not benefit them. Yet they knew that whoever deals in it will have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable is what they sold their souls for, if they only knew.
Had they believed and been righteous, the reward from Allah would have been better, if they only knew. 
O you who believe! Do not say ambiguous words, but say words of respect, and listen. The disbelievers will have a painful torment.
It is never the wish of the disbelievers from among the People of the Book, nor of the polytheists, that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But Allah chooses for His mercy whomever He wills. Allah is Possessor of Sublime Grace.
The parable of those who disbelieve is that of someone who calls upon someone who hears nothing except screaming and yelling. Deaf, dumb, and blind—they do not understand.
O you who believe! Eat of the good things We have provided for you, and give thanks to Allah, if it is Him that you serve.
He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and what was dedicated to other than Allah. But if anyone is compelled, without desiring or exceeding, he commits no sin. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Those who conceal what Allah revealed in the Book, and exchange it for a small price— those swallow nothing but fire into their bellies. And Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
It is they who exchange guidance for error, and forgiveness for punishment. But why do they insist on the Fire?
 That is because Allah has revealed the Book in truth; and those who differ about the Book are in deep discord.
O you who believe! Retaliation for the murdered is ordained upon you: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the female for the female. But if he is forgiven by his kin, then grant any reasonable demand, and pay with good will. This is a concession from your Lord, and a mercy. But whoever commits aggression after that, a painful torment awaits him.
There is life for you in retaliation, O people of understanding, so that you may refrain.
As for those who defy Allah’s revelations, and kill the prophets unjustly, and kill those who advocate justice among the people— promise them a painful retribution. 
They are those whose deeds will come to nothing, in this world and in the Hereafter; and they will have no saviors.
Those—their penalty is that upon them falls the curse of Allah, and of the angels, and of all mankind.
Remaining in it eternally, without their punishment being eased from them, and without being reprieved.
Except those who repent afterwards, and reform; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
As for those who disbelieve after having believed, then plunge deeper into disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted; these are the lost.
As for those who disbelieve and die disbelievers, even the earth full of gold would not be accepted from any of them, were he to offer it for ransom. These will have a painful torment, and will have no saviors.
You will not attain virtuous conduct until you give of what you cherish. Whatever you give away, Allah is aware of it. 
And do not be saddened by those who rush into disbelief. They will not harm Allah in the least. Allah desires to give them no share in the Hereafter. A terrible torment awaits them.
Those who exchange blasphemy for faith will not harm Allah in the least. A painful torment awaits them.
Those who disbelieve should not assume that We respite them for their own good. In fact, We only respite them so that they may increase in sinfulness. A humiliating torment awaits them.
Every soul will have a taste of death, and you will receive your recompense on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the Fire, and admitted to Paradise, has won. The life of this world is merely enjoyment of delusion.
You will be tested through your possessions and your persons; and you will hear from those who received the Scripture before you, and from the idol worshipers, much abuse. But if you persevere and lead a righteous life—that indeed is a mark of great determination. 
Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done—do not think they can evade the punishment. They will have a painful punishment. 
But repentance is not available for those who commit evils, until when death approaches one of them, he says, “Now I repent,” nor for those who die as disbelievers. These—We have prepared for them a painful torment.
Those of your women who commit lewdness, you must have four witnesses against them, from among you. If they testify, confine them to the homes until death claims them, or Allah makes a way for them. Repentance is available from Allah for those who commit evil out of ignorance, and then repent soon after. These—Allah will relent towards them. Those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe, then disbelieve, then increase in disbelief, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to a way. Inform the hypocrites that they will have a painful punishment. Those who ally themselves with the disbelievers instead of the believers. Do they seek glory in them? 
The hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the Fire, and you will find no helper for them. These are the unbelievers, truly. We have prepared for the unbelievers a shameful punishment. We have prepared for the faithless among them a painful torment.
Prohibited for you are carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, and animals dedicated to other than Allah; also the flesh of animals strangled, killed violently, killed by a fall, gored to death, mangled by wild animals—except what you rescue, and animals sacrificed on altars; and the practice of drawing lots. For it is immoral. Today, those who disbelieve have despaired of your religion, so do not fear them, but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, and have completed My favor upon you.But whoever is compelled by hunger, with no intent of wrongdoing—Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
I would rather you bear my sin and your sin, and you become among the inmates of the Fire. Such is the reward for the evildoers.
The punishment for those who fight Allah and His Messenger, and strive to spread corruption on earth, is that they be killed, or crucified, or have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, or be banished from the land. That is to disgrace them in this life; and in the Hereafter they will have a terrible punishment.
As for those who disbelieve, even if they owned everything on earth, and the like of it with it, and they offered it to ransom themselves from the torment of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them. For them is a painful punishment.
They will want to leave the Fire, but they will not leave it. For them is a lasting punishment.

Those who criticize the believers who give charity voluntarily, and ridicule those who find nothing to give except their own efforts — they will have a painful punishment.
When he reached his maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. We thus reward the righteous.  She in whose house he was living tried to seduce him. She shut the doors, and said, “I am yours.” He said, “Allah forbid! He is my Lord. He has given me a good home. Sinners never succeed.” She desired him, and he desired her, had he not seen the proof of his Lord. It was thus that We diverted evil and indecency away from him. He was one of Our loyal servants. As they raced towards the door, she tore his shirt from behind. At the door, they ran into her husband. She said, “What is the penalty for him who desired to dishonor your wife, except imprisonment or a painful punishment?”
He said, “It was she who tried to seduce me.” A witness from her household suggested: “If his shirt is torn from the front: then she has told the truth, and he is the liar. But if his shirt is torn from the back: then she has lied, and he is the truthful.” And when he saw that his shirt was torn from the back, he said, “This is a woman's scheme. Your scheming is serious indeed.”
I had no authority over you, except that I called you, and you answered me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves. I cannot come to your aid, nor can you come to my aid. I reject your associating with me in the past. The wrongdoers will have a torment most painful.
And that My punishment is the painful punishment.

A brief enjoyment—then they will have a painful punishment.
