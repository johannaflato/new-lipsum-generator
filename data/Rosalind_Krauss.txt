One is the hum of charge and discharge as the pleasure principle operates toward the release of tension and the maintenance of the lowest levels of excitation. This rhythm, which is the on/off throb of + - + - + -, or of the presence and absence of contact, can be seen as the metrical “figure” of to beat: its form. But the second pulse is not a principle of recurrence guaranteeing that an “on” will always follow an “off”; it maps the principle, instead, of interruption. It is a pulse that is rather to be figures as + 0, which is to say existence followed by total extinction. The anxiety that is part of the affect of A Child Is Being Beaten, combining with its erotic pleasure, arises precisely from the force of rupture that is recurrent in the rhythm of the figure, a rupture that is not experienced as the onset of yet another contact but as an absolute break, that discontinuity without end that is death. Thus it is the death drive, operating below the pleasure principle, Lyotard sees, that transcodes this rhythm—as it beats with the alternation between pleasure and extinction—into a compulsion to repeat. The matrix is the form that figures recurrence.
The beating of the zootrope, cranking up to speed, the beating of the gull’s wings within the imaginary space, the beating of all those mechanical devices through which the real appears to burst into life from the shards of the inorganic and deathly still, and the particular form of the pleasure connected to that rhythm, And this is the rhythm, he knew as well, that will allow the erotic currents of the dream to surface.
The verticality of the fingers with the ball at their tips rephallicized the image, causing a meaning to rise upward, to flood back over the lineaments of the baffling genital secret; in it he could see the woman’s body beckoning with all the pleasure and terror of the dawning excitement of the experience of sexual difference. They are women falling, falling from the vertical into the horizontal. How is it that with that simple implication of falling, ecstasy is produced as image?
Mouth/anus. A straight line. The formal relations of the alimentary drive. And the eyes have driven the mouth into obscurity. Yet this architecture of the human will be transformed in moments of greatest pain or greatest pleasure. Then, the subject will grip his or her neck and, throwing the head fully back, will reassume that position in which it is the mouth that is at the end of the vertebral column. And from this newly projecting, newly expressive member there will issue the cry.
Rotating the head to produce the mouth as the human “prow” is not an elevation of the mouth but a lowering of the human structure, which has, by assuming the animal “geometry,” fallen into the horizontal. So many falling bodies. So many mouths brought uppermost.  Rotate the image of body and you produce a different geography. A geography that undoes the form of the human form.
Or, and why not, there is the television set itself, this impassive eye that nonetheless exudes a constant visual beat since its image is produced by an electric current scanning upward along the hundreds of lines that cross the screen, generating an “image” through the continual renewal of its pulse, Why could it not be said that the screen’s flicker, witness to its almost imperceptible mechanical pulse, provides the matrix, the formal support or “ground” against which these pounding, kicking, scratching, gouging “figures” of pain can be bodied forth to provide their full component of pleasure?
