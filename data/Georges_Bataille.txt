Pleasure only starts once the worm has got into the fruit; to become delightful, happiness must be tainted with poison.
To experience the slow pleasure, the decisive rigour of firm despair, to be hard, and guarantor of death rather than victim. The difficulty, in despair,  is to be whole: however, the words, as I write, fail me . . . Egotism inherent in despair: in it arises the indifference to communication. ‘Arises’ at the very least, for ... I write.  I say ‘despair’ - one must understand me: here I am  defeated, in the depths of cold, inhaling an odour of death, at the same time lethargic, committed to my destiny, loving it - like an animal its little ones - no longer desiring anything. The summit of joy is not joy, for, in joy, I sense the moment coming when it will end, while, in despair, I sense only  death coming: I have of it only an anguished desire, but a desire and no  other desire. Despair is simple: it is the absence of hope, of all enticement. To this fruitless task I am compelled - happily?  Noises of all sorts, cries, chatter, laughter - it is necessary that everything be lost within him, become empty of  meaning in his despair.
When I suffer I become attached to little pleasures. The nostalgia for salvation responds perhaps to the increase of suffering (or rather to the incapacity to bear it). The idea of salvation comes, I believe, from one whom suffering breaks apart. He who masters it, on the contrary, needs to be broken, to proceed on the path towards rupture. 
My life (or rather my lack of one) is my method. Less and less do I question to know. That’s something that pretty much leaves me indifferent. And I live. And I question in order to live. I live out my quest, I’m alone with myself, lacking the previous means of escape (pleasure, excitement). I have to get a grip. If I don’t, is there any alternative? Getting a grip? Easy! Though ... I myself in control of myself could scare me. 
Since it is true that one of a man’s attributes is the derivation of pleasure from the suffering of others, and that erotic pleasure is not only the negation of an agony that takes place at the same instant, but also a lubricious participation in that agony, it is lime to choose between the conduct of cowards afraid of their own joyful excesses, and the conduct of those who judge that any given man need not cower like a hunted animal, but instead can see all the moralistic buffoons as so many dogs.
But this laughter, which accentuates the pleasure - pain opposition (pain and  death merit respect, whereas pleasure is derisory, deserving of contempt), also underscores their fundamental kinship. Man’s reaction has ceased to betoken respect: his laughter is the sign of aversion, of horror. Laughter is the compromise attitude man adopts when confronted by something whose appearance repels him, but which at the same time does not strike him as particularly grave. And thus when eroticism is considered with gravity, considered tragically, this represents a complete reversal of the ordinary situation. 
I wish right away to make clear the total futility of those often-repeated statements to the effect that sexual prohibitions boil down to no more than prejudices which it is high time we got rid of. The shame; the modesty sensed in connection with the strong sensation of pleasure, would be, so the argument runs, mere proofs of backwardness and unintelligence.
And there would be no knowing what is happening if one were to know nothing of the extremest pleasure if one knew nothing of extremest pain.
