Then the beaks are forced between the lips, and it is impossible to offer any real resistance despite their apparent fragility. When the feeders have gone, at times some of the bodies start to make long and sweet raucous howls, never-ending. Or some start to laugh and shake their heads in all directions. They are drunk, to tell the truth, and they shout, they make all kinds of noises with their throats. Others fall asleep. Time stands still. One hardly speaks. They were called mermaids.
They struggle violently. In the end all the bodies are taken prisoner. They treat the bodies very gently and rock them in their arms to calm them when they are caught. Later on they place them on tables in the relaxation rooms, and they start to massage them by covering them with benzoin oil. Their skin gleams. Sometimes one of the bodies, slipping in the hands of the masseur, falls to the floor and lets out a loud cry. The beings come to the garden when they organize parties. 
For the ones so summoned, there is no other option but to bow their head to their chest or close their eyes. Sometimes the beings ask mocking questions. No one responds even when threatened with beatings. Without waiting for them to arrive, the beings turn and leave together, laughing and making remarks. The body writhes about on the ground and rolls over, sometimes on the belly with head held high, sometimes on the back, split legs convulsively projected in the air. One of the big apes seizes the body, rocking to calm it, and wipes away the sand sticking to the recently oiled skin. At times during the feasts the milking of the bodies takes place in the garden paths instead of the relaxation rooms. The big apes place the milking machines on the sexes in the presence of the beings. On these occasions there are a lot of beings. 
The trumpets flourish as the being flings its hands in studded gloves at full speed on the body’s backside. The music covers the cries except for those who are nearby. Only the satisfied bodies enjoy the beating. Other than the pain caused by the blows, the facedown position on the being’s knees is in itself a source of misery because of the enormous pressure exerted by the body when bellydown on the sex. Each blow applied to the buttocks is such a shock to the body that the heart stops beating. Sometimes the winner is carried away unconscious to a deck chair to the rapturous applause of the standing beings. 
Their task consists of making the bodies talk. They themselves don’t say anything. When the bodies refuse to talk in the course of the guardians’ intervention, the feeders are called to pour the appropriate liquids into their mouths. That’s what the guardians call untying the tongues. Tongues thus untied talk, and even if one plugs up one’s ears the repeated recriminations are heard.
It is preserved in this form in the cheeks that have developed interior pockets from uninterrupted suction. It is there that the desired putrefaction or fermentation takes place. Each one contributes a concentration so intense that the restlessness is calmed. From now on silence reigns in the garden paths. The creative games of the satisfied bodies are not interrupted. The reading sessions go on, too, with eyes shut, all of one’s attention fixed on the putrefaction in progress. The time to act may be tomorrow. And if it takes dying, hold on to this sovereign happiness, vile creature to whom nothing on this earth belongs, except to die. Is it not written that in risking death you will cease to be a slave?
