Misadventure of desire at the hedges of jouissance, watched out for by an evil god. This drama is not as accidental as it is believed to be. It is essential: for desire comes from the Other, and jouissance is located on the side of the Thing.
Castration means that jouissance has to be refused in order to be attained on the inverse scale of the Law of desire.
What I want is the good of others provided it remain in the image of my own.
Lebensneid is not an ordinary jealousy, it is the jealousy born in a subject in his relation to an other, insofar as this other is held to enjoy a certain from jouissance or superabundant vitality, that the subject perceives as something that he cannot apprehend by means of even the most elementary of affective movements. Isn’t it strange, very odd, that a being admits to being jealous of something in the other to the point of hatred and the need to destroy, jealous of something that he is incapable of apprehending in any way, by any intuitive path?
It begins with a tickle and ends in a blaze of petrol. That's always what jouissance is.
Jouissance is always of the order of tension, of forcing, of expenditure, even of exploit. Jouissance is undoubtedly there at the point where pain begins to appear.
To enjoy, one needs a body.
Only love allows jouissance to condescend to desire. The subject will realise that his desire is merely a vain detour with the aim of catching the jouissance of the other.
Jouissance presents itself as buried at the centre of a field and has the characteristics of inaccessibility, obscurity and opacity; moreover, the field is surrounded by a barrier which makes access to it difficult for the subject to the point of inaccessibility, because jouissance appears not purely and simply as the satisfaction of a need, but as the satisfaction of a drive.
This track, this pathway, is familiar to us. It’s ancestral knowledge. And what is this knowledge, if we don’t forget that Freud introduces what he himself calls ‘beyond the pleasure principle,’ the pleasure principle itself not being overturned thereby? Knowledge is what brings life to a halt at a certain limit on the path to jouissance. For the path toward death — this is what is at issue, it’s a discourse about masochism — the path toward death is nothing other than what is called jouissance.
For it is pleasure that sets limits to jouissance, pleasure as what binds incoherent life together, until another prohibition – this one being unchallengeable — arises from the regulation that Freud discovered as the primary process and relevant law of pleasure.
If the paths to jouissance have something in them that dies out, that tends to make them impassable, prohibition, if I may say so, becomes its all-terrain vehicle, its half-track truck, that gets it out of the circuitous routes that lead man back in a roundabout way toward the rut of a short and well-trodden satisfaction.
What’s disturbing is that if one pays in jouissance, then one has got it, and then, once one has got it it is very urgent that one squander it. If one does not squander it, there will be all sorts of consequences.
The subjects know, they know. But all the same, they don't know everything. At the level of this not-everything, only the Other doesn't know. It is the Other who constitutes the not-everything, precisely in that the Other is the part of the not-at-all-knowledgeable in the not-everything.
And what does it help her do? It helps her, as everyone knows, make the speaking being, who is reduced here to man, speak, in other words it helps her exist only as mother.
