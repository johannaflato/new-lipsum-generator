Development is confused with the development of mastery. It is here that one must have a good ear, like in music — I am the master, I progress along the path of mastery, I am the master of myself as I am of the universe. That is what I was talking about earlier, the vanquished idiot. The universe is a flower of rhetoric. This literary echo may perhaps help us understand that the ego can also be a flower of rhetoric, which grows in the pot of the pleasure principle that Freud calls "Lustprinzip," and that I define as that which is satisfied by blah-blah.
That is what I am saying when I say that the unconscious is structured like a language. But I must dot the i's and cross the t's. The universe — you might realize it by now, all the same, given the way in which I have accentuated the use of certain words, the "whole" and the "not-whole," and their differential application to the two sexes — the universe is the place where, due to the fact of speaking, everything succeeds.
Normally I would expect to hear some snickering now — alas, I don't hear any. Snickering would mean "So, you've admitted it, there are two ways to make the sexual relationship fail." That is how the music of the epithalamion is modulated. They revolve around the fact that there's no such thing as a sexual relationship.
There is thus the male way of revolving around it, and then the other one, that I will not designate otherwise because it's what I'm in the process of elaborating this year — how that is elaborated in the female way. It is elaborated on the basis of the not-whole. But as, up until now, the not-whole has not been amply explored, it's obviously giving me a hard time.
On that note, I am going to tell you a good one to distract you a bit. 
I almost regret having, in this way, said enough, which always means too much. Next time, I will try to enunciate in a way that stands up — and that is complete enough for you to bear the time before we meet again, in other words, half a month — that, for woman — but write woman with the slanted line with which I designate what must be barred — for Woman, something other than object a is at stake in what comes to make up for the sexual relationship that does not exist.
They are written on the triangle constituted by the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real. To the right is the scant reality on which the pleasure  principle is based, which is such that everything we are allowed to approach by way of reality remains rooted in fantasy.
Ultimately, they began with the notion that each one should know what keeps it in being — that had to be its good, in other words, what gives it pleasure.
The subjects know, they know. But all the same, they don't know everything. At the level of this not-everything, only the Other doesn't know. It is the Other who constitutes the not-everything, precisely in that the Other is the part of the not-at-all-knowledgeable in the not-everything.
And what does it help her do? It helps her, as everyone knows, make the speaking being, who is reduced here to man, speak, in other words it helps her exist only as mother. She has unconscious effects, but her unconscious — at the limit point at which she is not responsible for everyone's unconscious, in other words, at the point at which the Other she deals with, the Other with a capital O, works in such a way that she knows nothing, because the Other knows even less, given how difficult it is to even maintain its existence — this unconscious, what can we say of it, if not to sustain with Freud that it doesn't leave her sitting pretty?
