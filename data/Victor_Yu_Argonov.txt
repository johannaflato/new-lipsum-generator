Pleasure (happiness, hedonic tone) is a measure of a creature’s subjective satisfaction with the current state of its consciousness regardless of the specific factors that have caused it: the measure of desirability of this state. Hedonic tone may be negative (suffering) or positive (pleasure per se).
Hedodynamics is a quantitative theory of individual behavior and societal development based on the pleasure principle.
Comfort is a hypothetical physiological parameter, unambiguously determining a creature’s volitional behavior according to Postulates, and being a neural correlate of pleasure according to Postulate.
Postulate 1: the existence of comfort. Any volitional actions of a conscious organism are determined by a single physiological parameter (comfort), which may take negative and positive values. In its behavior, an organism either strives to maximize the current value of comfort, or only avoids negative current values of comfort (the particular option is to be determined by experiments).
Postulate 2: the correlation between comfort and pleasure. Comfort is a neural correlate of pleasure. Negative values of comfort correspond to suffering and negative emotions, while positive values of comfort correspond to pleasure per se and positive emotions.
Postulate 3: the universality of comfort. Comfort has a similar physiological nature in all possible conscious creatures. 
Postulate 4: the correlation between comfort and utility. Intellect considers the maximization of utility as a dominating goal. There is a positive correlation between the predicted value of utility and the current value of q. This stimulates an animal to maximize utility.
Today, many authors suggest that not catecholamines but opioids must be regarded as a “real substance of pleasure.” Using opiate drugs, humans feel pleasure that is much stronger than was reported in old “pleasure center” stimulation experiments. New experiments have shown that opioids influence mice even after “switching off” major dopamine mechanisms. Kent Berridge discovered two small hedonic “hotspots” in a cubic millimeter of the rostrodorsal region of the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens and in the ventral pallidum  and showed that they produce much more clear hedonistic effect than Olds’s “pleasure centers”. He hypothesizes that opioid-receptors in these “hotspots” might be real “receptors of pleasure” of the brain. 
Neurochemical theories of pleasure have one serious drawback: they do not clarify the particular physiological parameter that might be unambiguously related to pleasure. There is always a chain of effects  and it is unknown which of them “really produces” pleasure. Cells that are not able to take required metabolites commit apoptosis , which is an analogue of suicide motivated by the absence of joy of life. 
It might be hypothesized that human pleasure is a sense of “satiety” of an individual’s neurons.  In normal conditions, in neurons, depolarization causes signal generation , and polarization restores to the normal or increased level (hyperpolarization). If an unpleasant factor presents too long, the cell spends all its energy, becomes exhausted and decays. Murik associates hyperpolarization directly with pleasant emotions, and depolarization with unpleasant emotions. This idea maps with the results of experiments showing a correlation between: (1) negative emotional behavior and brain polarization with electrodes ; (2) neural depolarization and phantom-limb pain; and, (3) neural hyperpolarization and the effects of opiates.
